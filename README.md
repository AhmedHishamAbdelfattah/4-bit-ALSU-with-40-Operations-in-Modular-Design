# 4-bit-ALSU-with-40-Operations-in-Modular-Design

## Overview
•	This project is about Design and Implementation of 4-bit ALSU with 40 Operations in Modular Design in Verilog HDL 
     
•	This Project is made in modular Design as I made the Architecture of Arithmetic & Arithmetical Shift Unit and the Architecture of Logical and Logic Shift unit and All the Blocks in the system.

•	And this Project includes also like 4-bit Divider and its Architecture, 4-bit Multiplier, Incrementer, Decrementer taking in consideration the Negative Sign in Operations Like Subtractor and Decrementer by making an output (Negative Sign Flag).

•	This Project also Contains Logic Operations like AND, OR, XOR, XNOR and a lot of other logical operations.

•	This project is mainly designed in around 3000 lines of Code using Verilog HDL as I made a design and Test Bench for each module individually and for the whole system (you Can See them from my Repo.)

•	You Can Find the full Documentation of the project in the files.
